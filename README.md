# Advanced-Learning-Algorithm

Welcome to the carefully curated repository including a comprehensive array of materials and in-depth notes from DeepLearning.Ai's secondary course, [Advanced Learning Algorithms](https://www.coursera.org/learn/advanced-learning-algorithms), which is part of the prestigious [Machine Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction) provided in unity with Stanford University. 

This repository serves as a professional reservoir, offering a comprehensive understanding of the core principles of machine learning. Delivered by the distinguished AI visionary, [Andrew Ng](https://www.andrewng.org/), whose illustrious career includes pivotal research leadership at Stanford University, as well as groundbreaking contributions to the field at Google Brain, Baidu, and Landing.Ai.
